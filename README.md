# Brokerage Calc

This is a test project, built in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). It has been designed to allow the importing of CSV files containing trading information, and serves as a basic report generator from those files.

## CSV to JSON

Largely, this was an experiment in taking CSV files and converting them to JSON objects, or vice versa. So in addition to an opportunity to learn more about Svelte, it was also a great opportunity to implement a CSV-JSON utility library. One I've used elsewhere, to great effect.
